## Key Goals of the Project
**1. Better Patient Management**

•	Keep accurate and updated records of patients, including their medical history and registrations.

•	Identify common health issues and how often treatments are needed.

 **2. Efficient Doctor Scheduling & Workload Analysis**
 
•	Track doctor availability, specialties, and experience to match them with the right patients.

•	Monitor appointment trends to find peak consultation hours and balance doctor workloads.

**3. Improved Appointment & Treatment Management**

•	Reduce inefficiencies by tracking appointments, cancellations, and no-shows
.
•	Identify the most common diagnoses and prescriptions to help hospitals prepare better.

**4. Financial & Revenue Insights**

•	Keep track of bills, payments (paid or pending), and overall revenue.

•	Break down hospital earnings by doctor specialty to identify high-demand services.

**5. Hospital Performance & Decision Making**

•	Use data insights to improve staff allocation and enhance patient care.

•	Spot inefficiencies in hospital operations and suggest improvements.

By using structured data and smart analysis, this project helps hospitals run more smoothly, improve financial tracking, and provide better patient care.
